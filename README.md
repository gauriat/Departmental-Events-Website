# Departmental-Events-Website

Our project revolves around the development of a comprehensive 
website dedicated to optimizing the management of departmental events. This initiative 
aims to provide a user-friendly interface where event organizers can efficiently plan, 
organize, and update event details. The website will offer intuitive features for seamless 
registration and participation tracking, allowing students and faculty to engage effortlessly 
with various events within the department.
